# the-office-group3#
While working on our group project, we did not come across too many problems.
The biggest things we had to overcome was learning the workflow, and getting used to
having multiple working on a project at the same time. We used a lot of communication
while working, to see who was working on what, and at what time. We also communicated
when we were ready to have a pull request completed, and updating our final page
from our working branch. We also asked the teacher for help, the first time cloning
the repository from a remote repository that was already created by a group member.
