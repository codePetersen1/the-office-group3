			<h2>Welcome to the Office</h2>
			<p><em>The Office</em> is a mockumentary that follows the events surrounding a paper company. We are able to see how a workplace is much more than the physical building and what the business goals are. 
				The people and the relationships are what we remember the most about our jobs. What <em>The Office</em> does so well is have characters that are relateable to ourselves, and those around us at our careers.
				We all work with Angelas and Kevins, or in some cases we are Angelas and Kevins. <em>The Office</em> reminds us that work is a grind for everyone. There are highs and lows. Ultimately our experience
				can be determined by our outlook. Andy Bernard says it the best when telling us he wished there was a way to know you're in the good old days before you've actually left them.</p>
