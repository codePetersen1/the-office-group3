            <p>www.creedthoughts.gov.www/creedthoughts is a fake website the beloved character Creed Bratton used as a personal blog to document his thoughts. However, the "wesbite" was made by character Ryan Howard, and it is merely a Word document. Luckily, Creed's thoughts were not made public for the entire World Wide Web to access.</p>
            <p>In the blog -- shown briefly during the show -- Creed had writted the following entries:</p>
            <p>Hey-o everyone out there in SyberWorld. It's old Creed Bratton coming at your again, here from my perch as a Quality Assurance Manager at Dunder Mifflin paper. Just a few observations on the world around me</p>
            <p>What do you guys think is the best kind of car? to me, you can't beat motorcycles. They're small and dangerous.</p>
            <p>Creed is a silly character whose lines are always memorable. One of his epic one-liners is: "Hey guys! Is somebody making soup?" He says this in season 2 episode 14, titled, "The Carpet," after someone pooped in Michael's office and the rest of The Office gang was plugging their noses.</p>
