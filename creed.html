            <p class="creed--text">This is the fake website the beloved character Creed Bratton used as a personal blog to document his thoughts. However, the "wesbite" was made by character Ryan Howard, and it is merely a Word document. Luckily, Creed's thoughts were not made public for the entire World Wide Web to access.</p>
            <p class="creed--text">In the blog -- shown briefly during the show -- Creed had written the following entries:</p>
            <p class="creed--text">"Hey-o everyone out there in SyberWorld. It's old Creed Bratton coming at you again, here from my perch as a Quality Assurance Manager at Dunder Mifflin paper. Just a few observations on the world around me."</p>
            <p class="creed--text">"What do you guys think is the best kind of car? To me, you can't beat motorcycles. They're small and dangerous."</p>

            <div class="creed__flex">
                <div class="creed--img__format">
                    <p class="creed--text">Creed is a silly character whose lines are always memorable. 
                    <p class="creed--text">One of his epic one-liners is: "Hey guys! Is somebody making soup?"</p>
                    <p class="creed--text">He says this in season 2 episode 14, titled, "The Carpet," after someone pooped in Michael's office. The rest of The Office gang was plugging their noses.</p>
                    <p class="creed--text">Enjoy the gif.</p>

            <p class="creed--text">Apparently, Creed is a former hippie who claims to have been born in 1925. He had a career as a rockstar and musician in the 60s. Somehow, he got a job at Dunder Mifflin and manages to not do any work throughout his day. He is usually seen playing solitaire on his computer. Most of his coworkers have no idea what Creed does in the office, and he also has no idea what he is supposed to be doing.</p>
            <p class="creed--text">Despite the silliness of his character, Creed ties the show together in its season finale. He sings a song called, "All the Faces." This is a real song by the real Creed Bratton's band called Grass Roots. It is a bittersweet ending to the show that made many viewers emotional.</p>
            <h2 class="creed--text">Watch the video below to hear Creed's finale song.</h2>
